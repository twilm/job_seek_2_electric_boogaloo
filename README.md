Job Seeker 2 Electric Boogaloo is a script I have written in order to automate the Job Search requirements for CenterLink in Australia.
This is currently hard coded to a specific town for demonstration purposes. Will update this shortly to ensure it is dynamic, and will take input. 



INSTRUCTIONS
===================================================================================
Firstly ensure Pip is up to date. 
with:
python -m pip install --upgrade pip


2. Install ChromeWebDriver (https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium)
3. pip install -r requirements.txt

Finally, to run the script:
python main.py 
May take a second, has a fair few requests to get through.
